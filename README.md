## Why should you use it?

Wing provides a base of styles, and you don't even need to learn a gazillion class names, all of your elements will be styled automatially. Not to mention, that unlike Bootstrap or other popular Frameworks, Wing is only **4kb** minified. Hope you enjoy!

## Get Started

**Install with npm**

```sh
$ npm install wingcss
```

**Link to It**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://usewing.ml/dist/wing.min.css"/>
```
